The Student object was not declared in the class in which it was tried to be used, it was tried to go through students_objects with range, inside the for index it makes reference to each object that is why the calls to other functions were not well written, if you want a read-only document the reference letter should be "r" not "w", if you want to pass to a function the value of the object you should put self.
